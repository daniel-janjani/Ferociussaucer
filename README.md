Nokias used to be all the fun, back then. I would always play with my father's - it had 2 games I really loved in particular. 
The first involved racing, while the second - as you can guess - was SNAKE. I really took my time to make sure the screen is as green as the original. And I also added a couple obstacles. Enjoy!
